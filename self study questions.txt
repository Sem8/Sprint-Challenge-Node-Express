1. Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

1an. 1) Express is a web application framework for Node.js. 2) With Express we can build web applications and serve Single Page Applications.


2. Describe Middleware?

2an. Middleware is a piece of code like a function that executes between the server receiving a request and sending a response.


3. Describe a Resource?

3an. Resource can be data stored in a backend database such as a list of hobbits a web user is requesting from the server.


4. What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

4an. A status code in the 200 range and actual data the client requested.


5. How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

5an. By doing what's called a separation of concerns. Breaking down each category of code into different folders and files inside folders and 
importing and exporting as necessary. 

add the cors npm module: yarn add cors or npm i cors.
add server.use(cors()) after server.use(express.json()).


Use create-react-app to create an application in a separate folder (outside the API project folder). Name it anything you want.
From the React application show a list of all projects using the API you built.
Add functionality to show the details of a project, including its actions, when clicking a project name in the list. Use React Router to navigate to a separate route to show the project details.
Add styling! Perhaps with styled-components.
